## Sarvagya Gupta

Sarvagya is a graduate student at University of Massachusetts in Boston, focusing on machine learning. His specific interessts include reinforcement learning, information theory, model compression, theoretical machine learning. 

### Specific Projects:

1. Object Detection and collision avoidence for self driving cars:

- A project I worked on at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India. Under the supervision of Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, we collected and curated the data by driving around the IISc campus and trained models on them. 

2. Equal superposition using reinforcement learning [(link)](https://bitbucket.org/Sarvagya8967/qc_code/src/master/):

- This was a code I wrote during my brief time at the Tata Institute of Fundemental Research in Mumbai. I worked on a small RL model to make any quantum state go to equal superpisition. 

3. Model Compression:

- I worked on a small model compression technique where I was able to reduce an MNIST classifier by almost 97% and achived accuracy of 85%. Currently working on bigger models like VGG and ResNet.
